# Mela-Riccia - the web-app cookbook of homemade recipes

This is my first open source project, combining my passion for programming and
my wife's good cooking gave rise to the idea of ​​building this project. The
web-app is a full stack project, the server handles http calls on the mongodb
database, and the client is built using react.js.

## Instructions

1. Clone the project:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Tanodrums88/Mela-Riccia.git
```

2. Change directory to the cloned folder:

```bash
$ cd Mela-Riccia
```

3. To install both frontend and backend dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Alternatively move to the respective folders:

```bash
cd server
$ npm install

cd client
$ npm install
```

4. To start both the server and the client, stay in the root directory and run
   the following command:

```bash
$ npm run watch
```
